# HW3 – LIGO Event Tutorial (STAT 159, Fall 2025)

This repository is my submission for **Homework 3: From Notebooks to Research Packages, Part II**  
in *Stat 159: Reproducible and Collaborative Data Science*.

# Binary Black Hole Signals in LIGO Open Data  

This project reproduces and extends the **LOSC Binary Black Hole Tutorial**,  
analyzing the first detected gravitational-wave event, **GW150914**.  
It demonstrates key **signal processing and matched filtering** steps used to identify the binary black hole merger in open LIGO data.  

This repository restructures the original LOSC tutorial for improved **reproducibility and modularity**,  following the HW3 guidelines.  
All code and data are adapted from the original LIGO Center for Open Science materials.
