[Update: Repository structure & paths ]
What I asked:
- How to refactor the LOSC tutorial notebook so raw inputs load from data/, and all figures/audio save into figures/ and audio/.

What I GOT:
- The high-level plan to (1) move *.hdf5 and *.json into data/, (2) change load paths (fnjson, fn_H1, fn_L1, fn_template) to "data/...", and (3) change all save paths to figures/ or audio/.
- A code pattern using pathlib for figure saving, e.g.:
    plt.savefig(str(FIG_DIR / f"{eventname}_H1_spectrogram.{plottype}"))
- Keep the tutorial’s eventname-based output naming convention while redirecting destinations to structured folders.
- Use pathlib Paths (FIG_DIR, AUDIO_DIR) 

[Update: Add tests for readligo.py]
What I asked:
What to test for in readligo.py and how to structure basic pytest functions.
What I GOT:
Guidance that good tests should confirm data consistency (matching lengths, valid numeric values, and presence of data-quality segments).
The idea to keep tests minimal: one for loaddata() output structure and one for dq_channel_to_seglist() behavior.
