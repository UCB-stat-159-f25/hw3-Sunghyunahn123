[Update: Repository structure & paths ]
What I asked:
- How to refactor the LOSC tutorial notebook so raw inputs load from data/, and all figures/audio save into figures/ and audio/.

What I GOT:
- The high-level plan to (1) move *.hdf5 and *.json into data/, (2) change load paths (fnjson, fn_H1, fn_L1, fn_template) to "data/...", and (3) change all save paths to figures/ or audio/.
- A code pattern using pathlib for figure saving, e.g.:
    plt.savefig(str(FIG_DIR / f"{eventname}_H1_spectrogram.{plottype}"))
- Keep the tutorial’s eventname-based output naming convention while redirecting destinations to structured folders.
- Use pathlib Paths (FIG_DIR, AUDIO_DIR) 

[Update: Add tests for readligo.py]
What I asked:
What to test for in readligo.py and how to structure basic pytest functions.
What I GOT:
Guidance that good tests should confirm data consistency (matching lengths, valid numeric values, and presence of data-quality segments).
The idea to keep tests minimal: one for loaddata() output structure and one for dq_channel_to_seglist() behavior.

[Update: Add tests for Makefile]
What I asked:
I used ChatGPT (GPT-5) to clarify how to structure a Makefile that automates the main workflow.
I asked about the general approach for setting up environment creation, building the MyST site, and cleaning output folders.
Based on the guidance, I wrote a minimal Makefile with three basic targets (env, html, and clean) that handle these tasks automatically.

After testing each command on JupyterHub, everything worked as expected —
the environment built correctly, the MyST site rendered locally, and the cleanup step removed temporary files.
This helped me better understand how Make can streamline reproducible workflows without manual setup each time.
